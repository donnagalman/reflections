When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	- When you are collaborating with other people on the same project, its efficient to create a repository rather than keeping it in the local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- There might be updates/changes that is not yet finished when its automatically pull that can cause error.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- Fork is cloning/copying the whole repository thru GitHub to GitHub only.
	- Clone - you can clone thru your Local to Github or vice versa
	- You can create new changes/updates on the same repository thru Branches

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	- I can still work on my repository even if I have no internet access as long as I have the updated/latest copy in my local.
